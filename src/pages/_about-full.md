I've recently graduated from Coder Academy with a Diploma of Information Technology. My passion lies in coding and creating accessible websites that solve real-world problems. My background in translation and project management has armed me with a solid foundation in problem-solving skills.

## Past experiences

I previously worked as a project manager and translator at a translation company in Melbourne. During my time there, I had the opportunity to collaborate with client developers and upload website translations via various CMS platforms. This experience made me realize the challenges that multilingual websites face, such as layout and typography issues. As someone who is passionate about language and culture, I wanted to make the web a more accessible place for people from diverse backgrounds, which led me to pursue coding.

## Interests

In my free time, I enjoy reading books, tackling jigsaw puzzles, playing video games, and spending quality time with my cat Jojo. I am an indoor person, but I also enjoy hiking and immersing myself in nature, as it helps me reconnect with the environment and clear my mind.
