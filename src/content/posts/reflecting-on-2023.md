2023 has been a special year for me. I made the significant decision to leave my previous job to pursue learning in web development. It's also the year that seemed to mark the retreat of COVID-19. I want to log what I've accomplished and experienced this year.

### January - February

I quit my job last Christmas and went back to my home country. It was my first visit back since the pandemic began. Lots of tears and laughter; and during this time, I had my first COVID.

_I stayed in a New Zealand hotel for a few days for quarantine before returning to China, where I quarantined for another week. Just after I finished my quarantine, China removed its quarantine requirements and opened its borders._

I've learned the following courses to get a high level understanding of frontend development:

- [HTML crashcourse | AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/frontend/html-crash-course)
- [CSS crashcourse | AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/frontend/css-crash-course)
- [Javascript crashcourse | AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/frontend/javascript-crash-course)
- [React Simplified | Web Dev Simplified](https://reactsimplified.com/)

### March

I learned more about JavaScript and found the following courses particular useful:

- [Learn JavaScript | Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)
- [Learn React | Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
  - I've built a [quiz app](https://github.com/wenxpan/quizzical) based on their instructions and figma design; my very first hands-on experience!
- [JavaScript Deep Dive | Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascript/)

I enrolled in Coder Academy's bootcamp course. Adventure awaits!

### April - August

What a ride! Learning solid development concepts with passionate tutors and many aspiring peers has been fantastic.

I've completed the following projects during my studies:

- [Portfolio (html, css)](https://github.com/wenxpan/WenxuanPan_T1A2)
- [Wordle Clone (python)](https://github.com/wenxpan/WenxuanPan_T1A3)
- [Cat Diet API (python, flask)](https://github.com/wenxpan/WenxuanPan_T2A2)
- [Digital Yearbook (MERN)](https://github.com/wenxpan/Full_Stack_App_T3A2-B-Frontend)

I also took advantage of LinkedIn Learning to explore various courses on UX design and web accessibility. It was very engaging, and I hope to adopt a user-centered approach in my development.

Oh, and one more significant milestone... I FINALLY learned how to ride a bicycle for the first time at 25! I'd consider it my greatest achievement this year.

### September

I took another break and went back to my home country. I celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival with my family for the first time in 8 years (since I began my studies in Australia).

### October

I decided to learn AWS, as I thought that was an important area not covered by Coder Academy. I prepared for a month and passed the SAA-C03 exam.

_So happy to receive this result!_

I found the following resources useful:

- [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03 | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03/)
- [Comparison of AWS Services | Tutorials Dojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/comparison-of-aws-services/)

The first few days of learning were somewhat painful - I had to deal with all the new terms and concepts, not fully understanding their purpose. But when it came to designing an architecture, everything suddenly clicked into place. The discussions on the trade-offs and benefits turned out to be incredibly interesting, and I can't wait to apply my knowledge to deploy my app on AWS.

### November

I started on my first full-stack app. It was challenging, but so fulfilling. I got to apply all my learnings to create something I've always wanted to build.

### December

I've studied more about AWS and passed the Certified Developer - Associate exam. Also lots of improvements on my Task Hatch app.

Overall, a quiet, calm festive season.

### My goals for 2024

- Learn more about Web Accessibility, mobile development, cloud services, AI
- Build more projects
- Find a job that matches my experience and interests
