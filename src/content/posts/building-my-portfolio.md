As a junior web developer, I felt the need to showcase my skills and passion for coding in the form of a personal portfolio. To build this, I utilized HTML and vanilla CSS, presenting a clean and responsive layout. This blog will detail how I developed my portfolio, discussing features and techniques used in the process.

## Planning the Structure: Sitemap and Wireframes

First and foremost, planning is crucial. To determine the structure of my portfolio, I started by creating a sitemap. A sitemap ensures a clear view of the hierarchical structure, making it easier to understand the organization and interaction between pages.

Once I had a clear site structure, I moved on to sketching wireframes. These rough sketches, not focusing on colors or fonts yet, gave me a preliminary vision of each page's layout.

## Coding the Layout: HTML and CSS

For the HTML structure, I primarily used semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and readability of the code.

I used vanilla CSS to style the pages, using relative units (such as percentages and rem) for better responsiveness, making content adapt to different screens and font sizes.

## Responsive Design

Responsive design is a crucial aspect of modern web development. I ensured that my website looked and functioned well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, using media queries to alter the layout according to the device width.

## Animations and Interactions

To make my website more engaging, I utilized CSS animations on the landing page. Also, I implemented hover effects on links and buttons to indicate interactivity, improving the user experience.

## The Final Product

The result is a clean, user-friendly, and responsive portfolio that showcases my skills as a web developer. It contains five main sections: Home, About, Projects, Blog, and Contact. Each section has been carefully designed to provide an informative and enjoyable user experience.
